          <p>
            Geographically, Surabaya is situated on the northern coast of Java

            estuary enhances its geographical significance as a thriving urban
            center. Its coastal location has historically made it a hub for
            trade and maritime activities. The city also experiences a tropical
            climate, with wet and dry seasons that shape its urban planning and

          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            Surabaya's history predates the colonial era, with the 1358 Trowulan
            I inscription marking its original name, Śūrabhaya, a vital village
            along the Brantas River. Scholars believe the city was founded in
            1275 AD by King Kertanegara for his soldiers. After defeating the
            Mongol forces, Raden Wijaya founded a palace in Ujung Galuh and
            appointed Jayengrono as leader. Jayengrono's crocodile magic
            threatened the Majapahit Kingdom, leading to a legendary seven-day
            duel with Sawunggaling along the Kali Mas in Peneleh. By the 14th
            century, the name Śūrabhaya was officially recognized.

          <h2>Current Leaders</h2>
          <p>
            Eri Cahyadi and his deputy Armuji, who began leading Surabaya in
            February 2021, have made remarkable strides in improving the city.
            Significant infrastructure development includes over 584 kilometers
            of roads and 1,177 neighborhood halls (Balai RW) for public
            services. They have also expanded public lighting by installing
            105,846 streetlights across thousands of locations. To address
            seasonal flooding, the administration has built over 109 kilometers
            of drainage channels and added seven new pumping stations, bringing
            the total to 75 by 2023. The city also revitalized 921 parks and
            expanded green areas to over 7,300 hectares, surpassing national
            standards.
