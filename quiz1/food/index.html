          <h2>Rujak Cingur</h2>
          <p>
            Rujak cingur holds a special place in Surabaya's culinary scene,
            representing the city's rich blend of flavors and traditions. Rujak
            cingur is a distinctive version of Indonesia's beloved rujak,
            traditionally a fruit salad made with various tropical fruits and a
            spicy-sweet dressing. What sets rujak cingur apart is its unique
            combination of fruits, vegetables, and an uncommon ingredientâ€”animal
            muzzle, usually from beef or buffalo. This East Javanese dish blends
            raw or boiled fruits and vegetables, giving it a diverse texture and
            flavor profile.
            <br />
            <br />
            The highlight of rujak cingur is its rich dressing, made with shrimp
            paste, peanuts, sugar, and chili, which adds a savory and spicy kick
            to the mix. Typically served on banana leaves and garnished with
            prawn crackers, the dish often includes rice cakes, tofu, or tempeh
            as side dishes. Rujak Cingur is a must-try for those seeking a taste
            of the area's unique culinary heritage.

          <h2>Pecel Semanggi</h2>
          <p>
            Pecel Semanggi is a traditional dish from Surabaya, East Java, made
            from steamed clover leaves (semanggi) served with a spicy peanut
            sauce. The dish is often enjoyed with bean sprouts and rice crackers
            known as kerupuk puli, which are made from rice. Its distinct flavor
            comes from the sauce, made with sweet potatoes, adding a unique
            twist to the typical Indonesian pecel. Pecel Semanggi is typically
            served on banana leaves, adding to its rustic appeal. Originating
            from the village of Kendung in West Surabaya, this dish reflects the
            resourcefulness of local villagers who used plants from their
            surroundings to create this beloved culinary specialty.

          <h2>Rawon</h2>
          <p>
            Rawon is a traditional Indonesian beef soup that hails from the
            Javanese cuisine of East Java, particularly from the city of
            Surabaya. This unique dish is known for its distinctive dark color,
            which comes from the key ingredient, buah kluwek or black keluak
            nut. The soup is made by slow-braising beef in a rich broth flavored
            with traditional Indonesian spices like lemongrass, lime leaves,
            ginger, and chili. The fermentation of the black nut adds an earthy,
            slightly sour flavor to the dish, creating a complex and savory
            taste that sets it apart from other Indonesian soups. Today, it is
            widely served in traditional Indonesian restaurants and is often
            accompanied by plain rice, salted eggs, bean sprouts, and sambal, a
            spicy Indonesian chili paste.
