          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            Surabaya's rich history predates the colonial era, with the Trowulan
            I inscription from 1358 AD indicating its original name, Śūrabhaya,
            a vital village along the Brantas River. Scholars suggest the city
            was established in 1275 AD by King Kertanegara for his soldiers. A
            captivating legend recounts the fierce battle between Adipati
            Jayengrono and Sawunggaling; after defeating the Mongol forces,
            Raden Wijaya founded a palace in Ujung Galuh and appointed
            Jayengrono as leader. However, Jayengrono's crocodile magic
            threatened the Majapahit Kingdom, leading to a legendary seven-day
            duel with Sawunggaling along the Kali Mas in Peneleh. By the 14th
            century, the name Śūrabhaya was officially recognized, solidifying
            the city's significance.

            streetlights across thousands of locations. To address seasonal
            flooding, the administration has built over 109 kilometers of
            drainage channels and seven new pumping stations, bringing the total
            to 75 pumps by 2023. The city has also prioritized the creation of
            green spaces, revitalizing 921 parks and expanding public green
