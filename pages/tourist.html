          <h2>Tugu Pahlawan</h2>
          <p>
            Tugu Pahlawan is a monumental landmark in Surabaya, standing 41.15
            meters tall with a unique inverted nail shape. Featuring 10 curved
            sections symbolizing the significant date of November 10, 1945, it
            commemorates the Battle of Surabaya, where the city's brave
            residents fought against Allied and Dutch forces seeking to
            re-colonize Indonesia after World War II. This pivotal battle
            showcased the courage of the Surabaya people, known as arek-arek
            Suroboyo.
            <br />
            <br />
            Located on Jalan Pahlawan near the East Java Governor's Office, Tugu
            Pahlawan is an iconic symbol of Surabaya, known as the "City of
            Heroes." Surrounded by landscaped gardens, the 1.3-hectare area
            attracts both locals and tourists, providing a serene environment
            for reflection. Every November 10, the site becomes the focal point
            for commemorations, drawing thousands to honor the heroes who
            sacrificed their lives for the nation's freedom. Tugu Pahlawan
            serves as a reminder of Surabaya's pivotal role in Indonesia's
            independence and its legacy as a center of national pride.

          <h2>Monumen Kapal Selam</h2>
          <p>
            Monumen Kapal Selam, or Monkasel, is a unique submarine museum
            located in Embong Kaliasin, Genteng, Surabaya. It features the KRI
            Pasopati 410, a Soviet-made submarine from 1952 that played a role
            in Indonesia's military history, particularly during the Battle of
            Aru to liberate Irian Barat from Dutch occupation. The submarine has
            been transformed into a museum, allowing visitors to explore its
            interior while also learning about its historical significance
            through film screenings and guided tours. Surrounded by amenities
            such as restaurants and souvenir shops, Monkasel offers an
            educational experience, making it a notable attraction in Surabaya.
            The museum highlights Indonesia's naval heritage and the challenges
            faced by sailors, providing insight into the country's maritime
            history and military achievements. Additionally, Monkasel serves as
            a symbol of national pride, commemorating the sacrifices made by
            Indonesian sailors in their pursuit of independence. Visitors can
            enjoy a scenic view of the surrounding area, enhancing their
            experience at this historic site.

          <h2>Kya Kya</h2>
          <p>
            Kya-Kya in Jalan Kembang Jepun, Surabaya, is a revitalized Chinatown
            area that has become a notable tourist destination. Officially
            reopened on September 10, 2022, the site aims to serve as a new
            cultural and culinary attraction. Visitors can explore the historic
            neighborhood on traditional becaks, visit ancient temples, and taste
            a variety of Chinese-Indonesian street foods. The area features
            around 60 local vendors, including 30 from the surrounding
            community, offering food and goods. Kya-Kya operates on weekends,
            with plans for further development to enhance its appeal. The local
            government has introduced initiatives such as repainting buildings
            in symbolic colors—black, red, and gold—and installing bilingual
            nameplates in Chinese and Indonesian to preserve its cultural
            heritage. This development is part of a broader plan to establish
            Kya-Kya as a key cultural and economic hub in Surabaya. It serves as
            a platform for local micro, small, and medium enterprises (UMKM) to
            thrive, boosting the city's economy. As visitors immerse themselves
            in the vibrant atmosphere, they can engage with local artisans and
            participate in cultural events.
